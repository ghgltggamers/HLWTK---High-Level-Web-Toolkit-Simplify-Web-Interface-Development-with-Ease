### How to Report:
- Please report vulnerabilities by opening an issue in the [security advisories section](https://github.com/ghgltggamers/HLWTK---High-Level-Web-Toolkit-Simplify-Web-Interface-Development-with-Ease/security/advisories) of the repository.

### What to Expect:
- We aim to respond to all security reports within **48 hours**.

### Our Commitment:
- We take security seriously and will work to resolve any vulnerabilities quickly.
